# Development guidelines


# Design guideline

* Do NOT use <a /> elements if there is logical navigation destination
* Avoid using bootstrap classes in the html
 * Instead use SASS to import/extend the appropriate classes in the .scss file
 * Ideally, with appropriate exceptions, design and layout should only occur in css
 * And, semantic structure should only occur in HTML
